                    <p> This is an early prototype of my cloud
                        chamber, it is silent, light weight, 
                        cheap and instantly working. I is also
                        with 4x viewable area compared to 
                        most other models. I also develop new 
                        experiments and demonstrations, 
                        including, vacuum, liquid nitogen, high 
                        voltage, high current and high velocity. 
                        Sometimes a great deal of sound also 
                        happens, typically when experimenting 
                        width high pressure.

                    <img src={vann} alt="Work Related Content" />
                    <p> My work is Supervisory Control and 
                        Data Acquisition (SCADA) development 
                        for Ã…lesund municipality's water 
                        treatment plant and sewage treatment.
                        Sensors are installed and configured 
                        by me before connection. Choosing 
                        between competing technologies can 
                        be exciting and challenging. Contact 
                        with service and equipment suppliers 
                        requires personal engagement.

                    <h3>Paragliding</h3>
                    <img src={pg} alt="Paragliding" />
                    <p> I'm an cross country paraglider pilot. 
                        Ranked no.11 2021 in Norway. I've between
                        paragliding since 2007. In 2013 I got my
                        paraglider instructor license, and I've 
                        been lead instructor for several beginner
                        courses. In my area there are mountains 
                        and fjords, quite spectacular scenery.

                    <img src={work} alt="Work Related Content" />
                    <p> I was a High School Science teacher. 
                        My subjects was mathematics, physics, 
                        informatics. I've also done private lessons for university
                    students in mathematics. I've got a self made 
                    persoal Website, but I'm also developer, content
                    manager and contributor to my paraglider club's 
                    site. I likes new areas to explore, so send me a 
                    message if you like what I do.

                    <h3>Electric Offroad</h3>
                    <img src={mc} alt="Motorbike" />
                    <p> I like nature, but I need strong input. 
                        Electric motocycles can offer low weight,
                        silent operation, high reliability, 
                        low maintainance cost. Noone is bothered about
                        invisible, inaudible and careful riders,
                        this can mean access to more nature. 
                        If pictured bike is what you choose.
