                    <p>This is an early prototype of my cloud chamber,
                    it is silent, light weight, cheap and instantly working. It
                    is also with 4x viewable area compared to most other models.
                    I also develop new experiments and demonstrations, including
                    vacuum, liquid nitogen, high voltage, high current and high velocity. Sometimes
                    a great deal of sound also happens, typically when experimenting width
                    high pressure.

                    <p> My work is Supervisory Control and 
                        Data Acquisition (SCADA) development 
                        for Ã…lesund municipality's water 
                        treatment plant and sewage treatment.
                        Sensors are installed and configured 
                        by me before connection. Choosing 
                        between competing technologies can 
                        be exciting and challenging. Contact 
                        with service and equipment suppliers 
                        requires personal engagement.
